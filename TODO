Multicall provider

Create multicall batch caller

1. Create multicall batcher interface
2. setup refresh interval
3. create array of calls then call Promise.all() if interval time ended
    Example:
        push contract call 1 into call pool
        push contract call 2 into call pool
        when timer reaches 0, execute Promise.call()
        Each contract call should have a callback to handle result

How to handle all calls
    - Ask sharad what info do we need for each type of """util"""
        pools, ctokens, oracles, etc
    - Create a controller which only handles calls related to its own controller
